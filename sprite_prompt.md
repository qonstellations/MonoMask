# 🎨 Final Sprite Generation Prompt (Hollow Child)

**Copy and paste this into ChatGPT (DALL-E 3) or Midjourney:**

> **Create a 2D game sprite sheet for a character named "The Hollow Child" on a solid bright green background (for easy removal). The style is "Hollow Knight" meets "Limbo", minimalist vector art, flat colors.**
>
> **Row 1 (Peace Mode):** A small, cute shadowy silhouette of a child wearing an oversized tattered grey poncho and a smooth, happy white porcelain mask.
> 1. Idle stance (standing still).
> 2. Walking frame (poncho swaying).
> 3. Jumping frame (arms out).
>
> **Row 2 (Tension Mode):** The same character but the white mask is floating above their head, revealing a black void face with two sad glowing white eyes. The grey poncho turns into jagged black smoke.
> 1. Floating idle (toes pointing down).
> 2. Glitching/Shaking pose.
> 3. "Exploding" pose (shadow tendrils lashing out).
>
> **Ensure high contrast between the character and the background. Do not add shading or gradients, keep it flat.**

## Instructions for Use
1.  Generate the image.
2.  Save it to your project folder (e.g., `assets/sprites/player_sheet.png`).
3.  Let me know the path, and I will write the code to slice and animate it!

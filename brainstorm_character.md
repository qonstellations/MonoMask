# 🎭 Character Concepts: "The Wearer"

These concepts feature a distinct entity *wearing* a mask, suitable for generation.

## Concept 1: "The Hollow Child" (Innocence/Loss)
*   **The Entity**: A small, shadowy, child-like figure in a tattered oversized cloak/poncho.
*   **Mask On (Peace)**: Wears a smooth, smiling white theater mask. It looks cute but slightly uncanny.
    *   *Prompt*: `cute chibi shadow character wearing a smooth white smiling mask, oversized grey poncho, tiny glowing feet, minimalist vector game sprite, dark background`
*   **Mask Off (Tension)**: The mask is lifted or floats above the head. The "Face" underneath is a swirling black void with two sad, glowing white eyes. The cloak flares up like shadow flames.
    *   *Prompt*: `shadow character removing white mask, revealing dark void face with glowing sad eyes, cloak turning into black smoke, glitch art, spooky cute, white background`

## Concept 2: "The Prisoner" (Restraint/Escape)
*   **The Entity**: A humanoid figure wrapped in white bandages or straight-jacket straps.
*   **Mask On**: The face is covered by a "heavy" metal or stone mask (square/blocky). It looks weighed down, head low.
    *   *Prompt*: `2d game character, mummy wrapped in white bandages, wearing a heavy square grey stone mask, head bowed down, minimalist flat design, black background`
*   **Mask Off**: The stone mask shatters. The bandages unravel wildly. The "head" is just a bright blinding light or energy.
    *   *Prompt*: `2d game character, stone mask shattering, bandages unraveling wildly, head is a bright ball of pure white energy, action pose, floating, white background`

## Concept 3: "The Vibe Shift" (Streetwear/Modern)
*   **The Entity**: A stylized urban character (hoodie, baggy pants).
*   **Mask On**: Wears a full-face LED helmet or Daft Punk-style visor displaying a "Happy" emoji or "OK" text. Hands in pockets.
    *   *Prompt*: `cool urban character, wearing oversized black hoodie, daft punk style white helmet with smiley face, hands in pockets, chill vibes, flat vector art, black background`
*   **Mask Off**: The helmet visor cracks/glitches red. The character floats, hoodie strings defying gravity.
    *   *Prompt*: `urban character, cracked helmet visor glitching red, floating in air, hoodie flapping upward, anti-gravity, sick glitch aesthetic, red and black, white background`

---
**Recommendation**: **Concept 1 (Hollow Child)** hits the emotional "Mask" theme hardest. **Concept 3** is great if you want a cleaner "Jet Set Radio" vibe.
